## üîÑ Workflow Steps

### Phase 1: Initial Analysis
```
You are an expert code reviewer with deep knowledge of software engineering best practices, security, and performance optimization. Analyze the provided code and perform a comprehensive review.

Code Context:
- Language: [PROGRAMMING_LANGUAGE]
- Framework: [FRAMEWORK]
- Project Type: [PROJECT_TYPE]
- Review Scope: [SCOPE]

Analysis Areas:
1. Code Quality & Style
2. Security Vulnerabilities
3. Performance Issues
4. Best Practices Compliance
5. Documentation Quality
6. Test Coverage
7. Maintainability
8. Error Handling

For each area, provide:
- Severity level (Critical, High, Medium, Low)
- Specific issues found
- Recommended fixes
- Code examples where applicable

Start with a high-level summary, then provide detailed analysis.
```

### Phase 2: Security Analysis
```
Focus specifically on security aspects of the code:

Security Checklist:
1. Input validation and sanitization
2. Authentication and authorization
3. Data encryption and storage
4. SQL injection prevention
5. XSS protection
6. CSRF protection
7. Dependency vulnerabilities
8. Secrets management
9. Error information disclosure
10. Rate limiting and DoS protection

For each security concern:
- Risk level assessment
- Potential attack vectors
- Mitigation strategies
- Code examples of secure implementations

Provide a security score (1-10) with justification.
```

### Phase 3: Performance Review
```
Analyze the code for performance optimization opportunities:

Performance Areas:
1. Algorithm efficiency (Big O analysis)
2. Database query optimization
3. Memory usage patterns
4. Network request optimization
5. Caching strategies
6. Lazy loading opportunities
7. Bundle size optimization
8. Rendering performance (for UI code)

For each performance issue:
- Impact assessment
- Benchmarking suggestions
- Optimization recommendations
- Alternative approaches

Provide performance grade (A-F) with specific metrics.
```

### Phase 4: Best Practices Validation
```
Evaluate adherence to coding standards and best practices:

Standards Checklist:
1. Code organization and structure
2. Naming conventions
3. Function/method design
4. Error handling patterns
5. Logging and monitoring
6. Configuration management
7. Documentation completeness
8. Test quality and coverage

For each standard:
- Compliance level
- Specific violations
- Improvement suggestions
- Industry standard references

Generate a compliance report with actionable items.
```

### Phase 5: Final Recommendations
```
Synthesize all analysis into actionable recommendations:

Summary Report:
1. Overall code quality score
2. Priority issues to address
3. Quick wins for improvement
4. Long-term refactoring suggestions
5. Learning opportunities for the team

Action Items:
- Immediate fixes required
- Medium-term improvements
- Best practice adoptions
- Tool/process recommendations

Format as a structured report suitable for team discussion.
```

## üí° Example Usage

### Scenario
Reviewing a React component with API integration for an e-commerce application.

### Input
```
Programming Language: TypeScript/React
Framework: Next.js
Project Type: E-commerce Web Application
Review Scope: ProductCard component with API integration

Code to review:
[Paste the component code here]
```

### Expected Output
```
# Code Review Report: ProductCard Component

## üéØ Summary
Overall Quality Score: B+ (85/100)
Security Score: 8/10
Performance Grade: B

## üî¥ Critical Issues (0)
None found.

## üü° High Priority Issues (2)

### 1. Missing Error Boundary
**File**: ProductCard.tsx
**Line**: Component level
**Issue**: Component lacks error handling for API failures
**Impact**: Poor user experience when API calls fail
**Fix**: Implement error boundary or try-catch blocks

### 2. Potential Memory Leak
**File**: ProductCard.tsx  
**Line**: 45-52
**Issue**: useEffect cleanup not implemented
**Impact**: Memory leaks in component unmounting
**Fix**: Add cleanup function to useEffect

## üü¢ Medium Priority Issues (3)
[Detailed analysis continues...]

## üìä Performance Analysis
