- Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)
- Churn Rate
- Active Users
- Support Tickets

Chart Types:
- Line chart for MRR trends
- Funnel chart for conversion rates
- Heat map for user activity
- Bar chart for feature usage

Data Categories: Revenue, Users, Support, Features
```

**Result**: Generated a complete dashboard layout in 15 minutes instead of 2 days of design work.

#### Phase 2: Component Development (Cursor)
Used **[React Component Generator](../prompts/cursor/code-generation/react-component-generator.md)** for individual components:

```
Component Name: MetricCard
