### The Prompt
The actual prompt text you'll copy and use. Look for:
- `[VARIABLES]` - Replace these with your specific requirements
- Clear instructions and context
- Expected output format
- Quality requirements

### Usage Examples
- **Scenario**: A realistic use case
- **Input**: What you would provide to the AI
- **Expected Output**: What the AI should generate

### Customization & Best Practices
- How to modify the prompt for different needs
- Tips for getting better results
- Common mistakes to avoid

## üõ†Ô∏è Tool-Specific Guides

## üé® Customizing Prompts

### Variable Replacement
Most prompts include variables you need to replace:

```
Component Name: [COMPONENT_NAME]
Purpose: [COMPONENT_PURPOSE]
Props: [PROP_SPECIFICATIONS]
```

Replace with your specific needs:
```
Component Name: UserProfile
Purpose: Display user information with edit capabilities
Props: user object, onEdit function, isEditable boolean
```

### Adding Context
Enhance prompts with your specific context:
- **Project requirements**: Mention your tech stack, constraints, or standards
- **Design system**: Include your component library or design tokens
- **Business logic**: Add domain-specific requirements
- **Performance needs**: Specify optimization requirements

### Combining Prompts
You can combine multiple prompts for complex tasks:
1. Start with a base prompt (e.g., component generation)
2. Add specific requirements from other prompts (e.g., testing, documentation)
3. Create a comprehensive request that covers all your needs

## üîÑ Workflow Examples

### Building a New Feature
1. **Planning**: Use documentation prompts to create specs
2. **Development**: Use code generation prompts for implementation
3. **Testing**: Use testing prompts to create comprehensive tests
4. **Review**: Use review prompts to ensure quality
5. **Documentation**: Use documentation prompts for final docs

### Improving Existing Code
1. **Analysis**: Use review prompts to identify issues
2. **Refactoring**: Use code generation prompts for improvements
3. **Testing**: Add tests using testing prompts
4. **Documentation**: Update docs with documentation prompts

### Rapid Prototyping
1. **UI Design**: Use V0.dev prompts for quick interfaces
2. **Backend Logic**: Use Windsurf prompts for API development
3. **Integration**: Use universal prompts for connecting components
4. **Deployment**: Use DevOps prompts for quick deployment

## üìä Measuring Success

### Quality Indicators
- **Code Quality**: Generated code passes linting and type checking
