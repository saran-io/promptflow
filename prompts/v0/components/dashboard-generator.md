## üí° Example Usage

### Scenario
You need to create an e-commerce analytics dashboard that shows sales performance, customer metrics, and product insights.

### Input
```
Dashboard Type: E-commerce Analytics Dashboard
Key Metrics: 
- Total Revenue (with % change)
- Orders Count (with % change)
- Average Order Value
- Customer Acquisition Cost
- Conversion Rate
- Top Products Performance

Chart Types:
- Line chart for revenue over time
- Bar chart for top products
- Donut chart for traffic sources
- Area chart for customer acquisition

Data Categories: Sales, Customers, Products, Marketing
```

### Expected Output
A complete dashboard interface with:
- Header with date range picker and export buttons
- 6 KPI cards showing key metrics with trend indicators
- Revenue trend line chart
- Top products bar chart
- Traffic sources donut chart
- Customer acquisition area chart
- Responsive grid layout
- Loading states and proper styling

## üé® Customization Options

### Variables to Replace
- `[DASHBOARD_TYPE]`: Type of dashboard (Analytics, Admin, Monitoring, etc.)
- `[KEY_METRICS]`: List of important metrics to display
- `[CHART_SPECIFICATIONS]`: Types of charts and their data requirements
- `[DATA_CATEGORIES]`: Main categories of data being visualized

### Optional Modifications
- **For real-time dashboards**: Add auto-refresh functionality and live data indicators
- **For mobile-first**: Prioritize mobile layout and touch interactions
- **For dark mode**: Include dark theme variants and theme switching
- **For advanced analytics**: Add drill-down capabilities and detailed views

## ‚úÖ Best Practices

### Do's
- ‚úÖ Use consistent spacing and typography throughout
- ‚úÖ Implement proper loading states for all data sections
- ‚úÖ Include empty states with helpful messaging
- ‚úÖ Make charts interactive with tooltips and hover effects
- ‚úÖ Use semantic colors for different data types

### Don'ts
- ‚ùå Don't overcrowd the interface with too many metrics
- ‚ùå Don't use too many different chart types in one view
- ‚ùå Don't forget mobile responsiveness
- ‚ùå Don't use colors that are not accessible

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue 1**: Charts not rendering properly on mobile
- **Solution**: Use responsive chart containers and adjust chart dimensions
- **Prevention**: Test on different screen sizes during development

**Issue 2**: Too much information causing cognitive overload
- **Solution**: Group related metrics and use progressive disclosure
- **Prevention**: Follow the 5¬±2 rule for information display

**Issue 3**: Poor performance with large datasets
- **Solution**: Implement pagination, virtualization, or data aggregation
- **Prevention**: Consider data loading strategies from the start

### Performance Tips
- Use chart libraries optimized for performance (Recharts, Chart.js)
- Implement lazy loading for non-critical sections
- Use proper memoization for expensive calculations
